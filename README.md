# APPLICATION OF HYBRID METAHEURISTIC WITH PERTURBATION-BASED K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS ALGORITHM AND DENSEST IMPUTATION TO COLLABORATIVE FILTERING IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
*Types of Recommendor System-*
There are three main types of recommendation systems –
1. Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering method is based on gathering and analyzing data on user’s behavior. This includes the user’s online  activities and predicting what they will like based on the similarity with other users.
2. Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering methods are based on the description of a product and a profile of the
user’s preferred choices. In this recommendation system, products are described using keywords, 
and a user profile is built to express the kind of item this user likes.
3. Hybrid Recommendation Systems
In hybrid recommendation systems, products are recommended using both content-based and
collaborative filtering simultaneously to suggest a broader range of products to customers. This 
recommendation system is up-and-coming and is said to provide more accurate recommendations 
than other recommender systems.

Conclusion-
Densest users based method i.e., KDI-KNN has outperformed all the other methods by a significant margin. Also, the other metaheuristics based methods have yielded significant improvements over the baseline KNN model. These results suggest that a hybrid model based on utilizing metaheuristics based methods along with KDI-KNN could yield even better results as presented in the original paper.
